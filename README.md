### Connecting to servers
- Next to the name box, there is a drop down menu with 3 options:
- Solo Server 443, Solo Server 4444, and Solo Server 8080.
- Note this is for if you're running the server on your PC.
- If you want to connect to a custom server, do the following:
- Put the server's IP in the Ip text box, or:
- First press the F12 key (or CTRL+SHIFT+I), then click the console tab at the top.
- Then type in the following: `setServer("serverIP:port")`.
- The client also has this tutorial at the bottom of the overlay.
